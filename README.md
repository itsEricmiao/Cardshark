# Cardshark

The game of Blackjack is one of the most popular casino games in the world. It is also the most winnable using a skill called Card Counting. Card Counting is the act of applying set values to different cards to keep track of the cards in circulation. This tally of cards allows the player to make intelligent assumptions about the likelihood of having a profitable hand. Card Counting is known for being relatively difficult requiring outside help or individuals gifted with memory and mathematics ability. Card Shark evens the odds and allows anyone with an iPhone to play like a pro!

As a disclaimer we acknowledge that such an app should never be used for actual card counting in a real situation. This app is just for fun in an informal setting.
